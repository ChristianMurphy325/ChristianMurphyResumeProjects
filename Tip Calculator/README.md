## Instructions

To receive credit for this lab, you must:

* Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment for this lab
* Write code that meets the specifications (below)
* Commit all code by the due date to your GitHub Classroom repository by the due date

## Specifications

*	When the app starts, it should display an empty text box and tip amounts of $0.00.
*	If the user enters a valid meal cost and clicks the Calculate button, the app should calculate and display the tip amounts as shown above.
*	If the user enters invalid data and clicks the Calculate button, the app should display a summary of validation errors above the form and $0.00 for the tip amounts.
*	The cost of the meal is required and must be a valid number that’s greater than 0.
*	If the user clicks the Clear link, the app should reset the page to how it was when the app first started.
*	Use the MVC pattern. To do that, create a model class that stores the cost of the meal and includes a helper method for calculating the tip percentages.
*	Use a Razor layout to store the ```<html>```, ```<head>```, and ```<body>``` elements.
*	Use a custom CSS style sheet to style the HTML elements so they appear as shown above.

## Rubric

* See the assignment in Blackboard for the grading rubric
